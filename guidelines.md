# Basic Guidelines:

### Branching:
* There is "master" and "development" branch available in remote. Always push all the changes to the development branch.

* Always try to create your own branch out of development to keep your work seperate and intact.

* Pushing changes to master is not possible. Always push changes to development. 

* Give proper commit messages so other teammates can understand the changes

### CSS Classes:
* Basic formatting of body, h1--h6, p.. and all common elements is being defined in the main css file. Make use of it and suggest changes if required.

* Go through the CSS classes list to see what can be re-used rather than created the same classes(or individual properties) again.
